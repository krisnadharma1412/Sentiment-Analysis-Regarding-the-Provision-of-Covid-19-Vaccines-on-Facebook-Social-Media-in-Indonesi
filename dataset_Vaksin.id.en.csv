Rivanda Rachmat,"Aluminum Compounds In Vxx-sin Safe ?? Source: Mas Djokpit Onthel A viral veterinary virologist and pro-vaccine doctor will usually use the analogy of antacids / gastric drugs as a proof / argument that aluminum compounds that enter the human body are safe. This time I want to dismantle the fatal error of opinion. Refer to a scientific reference book on aluminum toxicology. The book explains that the absorption of aluminum compounds in the digestive tract is very low and varied. Systemic absorption of some aluminum compounds is highest at around 0.5% - 5% for example in aluminum citrate and aluminum maltolate compounds (note what I underlined in the third picture). Aluminum hydroxide antacid compound in gastric medicine, the systemic absorption rate in the gastrointestinal tract is less than 0.01%. So the systemic absorption of aluminum compounds in antacid drugs is very, very low, only 0.01% and the rest will mostly be excreted through feces. While the aluminum compound in the vaccine is injected directly into a vein entirely. That means the absorption rate of aluminum compounds through injection is 100%. All aluminum compounds in the vaccine will enter the systemic bloodstream and spread throughout the body. aluminum in antacid drugs because it differs greatly in its absorption rate into the systemic vasculature. That means the absorption rate of aluminum compounds through injection is 100%.

Rivanda Rachmat,"Anonymous's question: The doctors and the doctors think the ingredients are safe. For example, aluminum hydroxide is found in gastric medications. Then he even said that the amount of aluminum in Pak Sin was smaller than that in breast milk. Then other ingredients such as NaCl are salt. Anyway, it's safe. How's that sir? Please enlighten me.. Answers 1. Doctors and health workers often equate substances that enter through the mouth into the stomach, with when the substance is injected. Of course the effects of the two are different 2. When a substance is said to be safe, its safety is not certain. They often say it's safe for something that can't be seen in the near future. They also often mention safe for something small / little. 3. They are educated to adhere to the medical curriculum they learned in college. Makes them often unable to think outside the box. Even though there are many things that are contrary to the medical curriculum and they still cannot accept it because it is contrary to their version of the truth. 4. The high cost of medical tuition and the difficulty / length of studying the science causes them to be controlled by the most understanding, most capable, most expert attitude. Even though any science is always changing all the time and there is no such thing as stopping learning throughout life, there is still a vaccine they can be accepted by the market and sold on target. You can't expect them to be honest and brave to open up about the dangers of the ingredients in these drugs and vaccines as long as they have to sell them and get triggered to get bonuses from them. In the end, many sick people were given inconsequential drug prescriptions, people with comorbidities should not be vaccinated and forced to vaccinate, they didn't need surgery, recommended surgery, didn't need to be on a ventilator, forced to use a ventilator, sick with viruses were given antibiotics which incidentally is for bacterial infections, etc. etc. herbs. Doctors and health workers who you think are great don't necessarily understand about nutrition, hygiene, natural medicines such as ginger, ginger, garlic, etc. In their education, they have received the doctrine to solve all diseases, even the mild and simple ones, with vaccines and medicines, which have very large side effects. For example, the recommendation for the flu vaccine every year, the covid vaccine. There's no need for suggestions like that, really. If there is indeed a virus, there is already quite a lot of literature showing that the combination of high doses of Vitamin C + Vitamin B complex + Vitamin D + Zinc is effective in boosting the immune system and fighting this covid virus infection (if any). However, the doctors and health workers who are said to be great rarely recommend these vitamins. The question is why? yes again no bonuses, no gains, no abundance for them 7. Healing / Health of patients is a loss for them. Your pain is a harvest for them. The existing vaccines with their harmful ingredients ensure that our bodies are always unfit in the long run, always having problems in the long run. Vaccines cause allergies/autoimmune. Vaccines cause neurological diseases. Vaccines cause paralysis. Vaccines cause reproductive disorders. Vaccines cause cancer, etc. Just name one human disease today for which there is no vaccine involved. I answered ""No"". All the diseases and disorders that you feel as an adult are the result of years of accumulation of toxic substances that should not enter the body but were injected into the body when we were small. Vaccines are the backbone of medicine / medicine, because without vaccines humans will have complete health. God is omniscient my brother, most knowledgeable, most merciful, most merciful. God would not have created us with defective bodies and immune systems.

ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF LOW ZETA POTENTIAL & MOULECTRUM ANOXIA SP. ANDREW MOULDEN, CANADA WHO DIED IN 2013 1. Vaccines are injected intramuscularly and enter the blood vessels speeding up the process of decline 6000 times. industrial waste treatment flocculants So what happened !!! bypass cellular immunity. 4. An increase in lymphocyte cells in the bloodstream along with a decrease in the Zeta Potential of the blood contributes to the concentration, coagulation and coagulation of blood. This is because the size of white blood cells is twice the size of red blood cells and these white blood cells cannot possibly enter the very small capillaries. The result is an excess number of white blood cells clogging / blocking the watershed area (area of ​​blood flow) in / near the capillaries. The presence of large numbers of white blood cells at the capillary openings, which is exacerbated by a decrease in the Zeta Potential, causes blood flow to slow down and prevents red blood cells from entering the capillaries and exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide for the cells and tissues they pass through. capillaries. 5. The supply of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide is important to ensure the cells / tissues / organs can always work properly. If there is a slowdown / cessation of blood flow that carries red blood cells to the capillaries, the cells / tissues / organs will lack oxygen supply and will slowly but surely lead to death. These organs vary. Hypoxia (low oxygen supply), anoxia (no oxygen supply at all), ischemia (low oxygen supply as a result of slowed blood flow), and stroke (the need for oxygen supply to cells exceeds the available oxygen supply). This type of reaction can cause chronic disease in humans, impairment, death, vaccine-induced autism spectrum disorder, sudden infant death syndrome, and multi-organ disease and functional impairment. which organ is blocked.

Blood Brain Barrier) so he brought the other ingredients in the AZ vaccine to brain tissue. This Blood Brain Barrier membrane functions to protect brain tissue from the infiltration of foreign pathogens and chemicals. When the BBB membrane is damaged, the brain tissue is more susceptible to exposure to pathogens and chemicals. The risk of damage to the BBB membrane will be worse for the fetus, infant, and young child. This is because this group has an immature/completely formed BBB membrane, thus potentially allowing larger foreign particles/contaminants to penetrate their brain quickly. Scientific Sources : cs titled, The blood-brain barrier: bottleneck in brain drug development. • Potential to trigger reproductive disorders / infertility in women, according to experiments in female rats. Ovaries lose corpora lutea and have degenerative follicles Scientific Sources : - Delayed effects of neonatal exposure to Tween 80 on female reproductive organs in rats. • Together with L-histidine, potentially trigger blood clotting (Blood Clotting), stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and tumor growth or recurrence in patients with certain types of cancer Scientific Sources : • Seizures / Seizures Scientific Sources : 2. L-histidine and L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, an essential amino acid that cannot be formed by other nutrients and is generally found in food because it is needed in small amounts by the body. • In small quantities, This material along with histamine is needed by the body because it functions to stimulate the digestive enzyme gastrin and helps the body utilize important minerals such as: zinc, iron, manganese, etc. Meanwhile, the excess histidine content in the AZ vaccine causes high histamine levels and triggers the body's immune system to attack the high histidine levels. In this case histidine together with histamine become allergic precursors in the body • Can cross the placental wall to the fetus. This causes spontaneous miscarriage in pregnant women and birth defects in infants • Triggers increased production of thrombin which is an enzyme that promotes the occurrence of blood clots / blood clots induced by surfactant and co-surfactant substances in the AZ vaccine. The surfactant is Polysorbate 80 and the co-surfactant is ethanol. The enzyme thrombin is an enzyme that regulates the conversion of a substance called fibrinogen into fibrin, the right material for blood clots. Increased levels of histidine in the blood – increased levels of histamine – increased production of the enzyme thrombin – accelerates the formation of fibrin which is the material for blood clots.

FURTHER OBSERVING THE SIDE EFFECTS OF BLOOD COLORS EXPERIENCED BY THE YOUTH OF 22 YEARS, JAKARTA AFTER RECEIVING THE ASTRAZENECA VACCINE ACCORDING TO GERMAN SCIENTISTS German scientist, Prof. Andreas Greinacher of the University of Greifswald has discovered why Astrazeneca and J&J's COVID-19 vaccines expose recipients to the deadly side effect of blood clots. According to him, both vaccines use an adenovirus vector that has been inserted with Spike glycoprotein SARS CoV-2 and processed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells which, after being injected, triggers an autoimmune response. tetraacetic acid (EDTA), is directly responsible for causing blood clotting. Immunoglobulins. inflammation throughout the body, because the immune system detects an infection by some kind of pathogen / foreign substance and then overreacts. This overreaction of the immune system causes lethal bleeding and clotting. He and his team call the injection of a vaccine that evokes an exaggerated immune response that is actually in a dormant/inactive state as “awakening a sleeping dragon” – awakening a sleeping dragon. This actually does not need to be done because the survival rate of this viral infection is more than 99.9 percent. He stated that this covid-19 vaccine kills, but pharmaceutical companies still want you to be injected. Another scientist, Prof. John Kelton from McMaster University, Canada said he and his team had confirmed Prof.'s findings. Greinacher, though, is still confirming how far the accuracy of the cause-and-effect finding is. . A J&J Company spokesperson stated, “We strongly support raising awareness of this unusual side effect and we are currently exploring collaboration with Dr. Greinacher."" stimulated by the vaccine.

Nanda Al Fajr,"Tips so that the pandemic can be controlled: 1. Those who died due to covid, since last year, recorded what commorbid (congenital or accompanying diseases when they died) were recorded. For example: Cancer, Heart, Diabetes, Lungs. 2. Then all residents who have the disease, are recorded, then they are the only ones who must be vaccinated and strictly carry out health procedures. 3. Those who do not have commorbidities do not need to be vaccinated or run prokes. The reason, A. The spread of the virus, can not be prevented only with masks. Because the size of the virus is much smaller than the size of the pores of the mask. If you want to be safe, wear a mask with an air filter like the SAS army mask. B. Healthy people's antibodies will be strong against covid. So far, our positivity rate is 15%, which means we can say that 45 million people have been exposed. And be safe. . So, Let's hope healthy people continue to do activities as usual, and it's enough for people who have commorbidities to take care of each other. Peace",Monday at 20:29
